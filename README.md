### What is this?

This allows me to automatically upload screenshots (or anything saved to `dir`) to dropbox, and copy the URL to my clipboard.

#### ... Why?

Because I used to use cloudapp, but there's no client for Ubuntu, so here we are.

##### Requirements

- (Linux) xclip, `apt-get install xclip`.
